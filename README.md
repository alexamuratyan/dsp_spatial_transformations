# dsp_spatial_transformations
Implementing the basic histogram equalization algorithm, and applying spatial transformations on images.

The code includes a "Rotate2D" function which accepts an input image and a rotation angle and outputs an image that is the input rotated around the center pixel of the image. Also, a "Translate2D" function which accepts an input image and a translation vector, and outputs an image that is the input image shifted/translated by the provided displacement vector.
